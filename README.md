# 📚 Advanced Programming Course

This repository showcases my work from the **Advanced Programming** course, where I focused on several core programming concepts in both Java and Python. These projects helped me deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), database handling, file management, and advanced collection usage.

## 🖥️ **Project 1 & 2: Collections, Files, and Advanced Topics in Java**

In these projects, I explored various advanced Java topics, including collections and file handling.

### 🌟 **Key Features**  
- **Collections**: Implementation and manipulation of lists, sets, and maps.  
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files with error handling and formatting.  
- **Advanced Topics**: Working with streams, exception handling, and other key Java features.

## 🛒 **Project 3: OOP in Python - Shopping Cart Management**

In this project, I implemented an object-oriented approach to managing a shopping cart for an e-commerce website. The system includes functionality to search and add items using "smart" search with hashtags.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Key Classes**:  
  - **Item**: Represents an individual item in the store.  
  - **ShoppingCart**: Manages a collection of items and their total cost.  
  - **Store**: Holds available items, facilitates search and cart operations.  

### 🌟 **Features**  
- **Item Management**: Adding and removing items from the cart.  
- **Smart Search**: Allows users to search for items using hashtags (e.g., #sale, #new).  
- **OOP Design**: Encapsulated classes and methods to provide a clean interface for the user.

## 🏫 **Project 4: SQLite Database Management in Java**

This project involved creating a student exercise management program using an SQLite database in Java. It includes multiple tables for managing users, exercises, questions, grades, and submission versions.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Language**: Java  
- **Database**: SQLite  
- **SQL**: Used for querying and managing the database.

### 🌟 **Features**  
- **Multiple Tables**: Five interrelated tables: users, exercises, questions, grades, and submissions.  
- **SQL Integration**: Handling SQL queries and updates in Java, connecting the program to the SQLite database.  
- **Student Management**: Facilitates managing student data, including exercise assignments, grades, and submission history.
